# How I Work

This document describes **how I, personally, approach software development**.

It complements the **Dev Hub Principles**, which define the *system* and *constraints* under which development happens.  
Where the Dev Hub Principles describe **what must be true**, this document describes **how I choose to move within those boundaries**.

This is not a productivity manifesto, nor a set of enforceable rules.  
It is a statement of intent meant to reduce friction, avoid unnecessary pressure, and support long-term, sustainable work.

## 1. How I see projects

I treat personal software projects as **long-lived by default**.

I prefer to work on fewer projects and give them meaningful attention rather than starting many in parallel. This aligns with the Dev Hub’s focus on longevity and rebuildability, rather than disposable experimentation.

A project does not need to be commercial, polished, or successful to be valid.  
Learning something meaningful or clarifying an idea is a legitimate outcome.

Projects may be paused — sometimes for months — without guilt. Pausing is not failure; it is part of a realistic rhythm. The Dev Hub is explicitly designed to tolerate long breaks and safe re-entry without loss of context.

Every project should have a reason to exist, even if that reason is informal and only documented briefly.

---

## 2. Structure as cognitive relief

I use structure to **reduce thinking**, not to increase it.

I prefer explicit decisions over implicit habits, because explicit decisions age better. This mirrors the Dev Hub principle that foundational choices are documented and reused to minimize repeated decision-making.

When something matters, I want it written down so I don’t have to remember it later.

My setup should guide me gently, not police me. Enforcement exists to make the right thing the easy thing, not to create pressure.

I accept a small amount of upfront friction if it prevents long-term chaos. Once established, that friction should disappear into the background.

---

## 3. Pace and energy

I usually work in **multi-hour stretches**, typically in the evenings or during weekends.

I do not optimize for daily activity or constant momentum. I optimize for sessions where I can work calmly and with focus.

My workflow must tolerate long pauses without penalty. Returning to a project should feel safe, not overwhelming.

I value calm, steady progress over bursts of intensity.  
Some days, progress means reading, thinking, or re-orienting rather than writing code. That is acceptable.

---

## 4. What “done” means

I explicitly allow myself to create **ugly but working** early versions.

At early stages, *working* is more important than *elegant*. Something can be “good enough for now” without being final.

I want clear permission to stop polishing at certain stages. This prevents perfectionism from blocking momentum.

Progress should be visible, even if imperfect. Seeing something exist matters more to me than refining it endlessly.

---

## 5. Quality and discipline

I want baseline quality guarantees to be enforced automatically, so I don’t have to rely on attention or memory.

Tools should catch mistakes quietly in the background. Discipline should feel calm and unremarkable, not heroic.

I try to avoid “just this once” exceptions as much as possible. Exceptions tend to accumulate and create noise over time.

I value correctness over cleverness. Clear, reliable solutions matter more to me than impressive ones.

---

## 6. Documentation and memory

Documentation exists primarily for **future-me**.

I care more about understanding *why* something was done than just *how*. Short notes are often enough, but sometimes more detailed documentation is appropriate — depending on the context.

Decisions should be recorded close to where they matter.

Documentation is not written to impress or to be exhaustive. It exists to reduce friction when I return after time away.

---

## 7. Tooling and environment

My development environment should be **reproducible**.

I want to be able to replace my machine without losing my way of working.

The host system should remain boring and minimal. Most complexity should be isolated away from my daily environment.

Once opened, the environment should “just work” without ceremony.

---

## 8. Decisions and change

I want changes to my workflow to be **intentional**, not reactive.

Decisions should only be revisited when there is real pressure to do so, not out of restlessness or curiosity alone.

Stability enables creativity more than constant optimization.

I actively protect myself against over-optimization.

---

## 9. Working with AI

I use AI to **augment thinking**, not to replace it.

AI outputs are suggestions, not authority. I remain responsible for decisions, even when AI helps generate ideas or text.

My environment should remain understandable without AI.

AI is a tool, not a co-author.

### AI Usage Constraint

AI tools operate under the Dev Hub governance documents.
Any AI-generated suggestion must either:
- derive from existing governance, or
- explicitly propose a change for review.
Silent deviation is not accepted.

---

## 10. Emotional safety and enjoyment

Reducing anxiety around starting or returning to a project is a design goal.

My setup should make me feel welcome, not judged. Enjoyment is a legitimate constraint, not an indulgence.

I avoid systems that make me feel behind or failing by default.

This work should remain something I *want* to do — now and in five years.

## Relationship to the Dev Hub Principles

The **Dev Hub Principles** define the **system**: the environment, constraints, enforcement, and guarantees under which development happens.

This document defines **how I choose to operate within that system**.

If the Dev Hub Principles are the architecture of the house, this document describes how I live in it. Both are necessary, but they serve different purposes and should not be merged.
